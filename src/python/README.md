# Python package

The structure of `package` directory is a skeleton for the python package. It includes python scripts with imports from python bindings. 

* You cannot use the python scripts from source directory. They will become usable once this skeleton is combined with C++ libraries and their python bindings. The default `cmake` configuration will take care of building a usable package.
