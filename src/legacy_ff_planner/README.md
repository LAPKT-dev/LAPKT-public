# lapkt 1.0 LEGACY planner frontend

Source code for executables. It uses boost program options to parse command line inputs. These planners are helpful for pure C++ debugging and performance evaluation. Otherwise, they are deprecated in favor of python bindings which we use to expose the lapkt core interface and let the user configure the planners in python.
