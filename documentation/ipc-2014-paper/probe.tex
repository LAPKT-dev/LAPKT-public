PROBE is a complete, standard greedy best first search (GBFS) STRIPS
planner using the standard {additive heuristic}~\cite{bonet:aij-hsp},
with just \emph{one change}: when a state is selected for expansion,
it first launches a \emph{probe} from the state to the goal~\cite{nir:icaps11}. If the
probe reaches the goal, the problem is solved and the solution is
returned. Otherwise, the states expanded by probe are added to the
open list, and control returns to the GBFS loop. The crucial
  and only novel part in the planning algorithm is the definition and
  computation of the probes.

PROBE is built using an early-version of an automated planning toolkit
that supports the implementation details of the width-based
algorithms. The only difference with respect to PROBE-IPC7 is that the
anytime procedure is disabled, as we are only concerned with the first
solution.
