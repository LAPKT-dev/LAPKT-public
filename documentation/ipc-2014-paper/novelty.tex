While the blind-search \SR\ procedure competes well with a greedy
best-first planner using the additive heuristic, neither planner is
state-of-the-art.  For this, we developed a standard
\emph{forward-search best-first planner} guided by an evaluation function
that combines the notions of novelty and
helpful actions \cite{nir:ecai12,hoffmann:ff}. In this planner, called $\textit{BFS(f)}$ \cite{nir:ecai12}, ties are broken
lexicographically by two other measures:
(1) the number of subgoals not yet achieved up to a node in the search, and
(2) the additive heuristic, $h_{add}$. The additive heuristic is delayed for non-helpful actions.
