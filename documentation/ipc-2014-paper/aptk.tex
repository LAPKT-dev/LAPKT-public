The planners $\SR$, $BFS(f)$ have been implemented using the automated planning
toolkit \texttt{lwaptk}\footnote{Source code available from
\url{https://github.com/miquelramirez/lwaptk}.}. The toolkit is an extensible \texttt{C++}
framework that decouples search and heuristic algorithms from \textsc{Pddl} parsing and grounding modules, by relying
on planner "agnostic" data structures to represent (ground) fluents and actions.
We consider \texttt{lwaptk} to be a valuable contribution in itself since it allows 
to develop, relying on a collection of readily available implementations of search algorithms and planning heuristics, 
planners which are independent from specific parsing modules and grounding algorithms. 
If the planner is to be acquiring descriptions of planning tasks from \textsc{Pddl} specifications, the toolkit
provides the means to plug into the planner either  \textsc{FF}~\cite{hoffmann:ff}
or \textsc{Fast-Downward}~\cite{helmert:fd} parsers. Alternatively, and more interestingly,
the planner can be embedded into complex applications, \emph{directly}, if the ``host'' application is written in 
\texttt{C++}, or \emph{indirectly} when the host is written in an interpreted language, such as \textsc{Python}, 
by wrapping the planner with suitably generated marshalling code.
