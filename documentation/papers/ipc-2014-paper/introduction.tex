
We entered the planners $\SR$, $BFS(f)$, and $PROBE$ to the
\emph{agile-track} of the 2014 International Planning Competition, and an anytime
planner for the \emph{satisficing track} that runs both $\SR$ and $BFS(f)$.
SIW and $BFS(f)$ are classical planners that make use of the notion of width \cite{nir:ecai12}, while PROBE is a standard best-first search planner that augments the expansion of a node by throwing an ``intelligent'' probe which
either reaches the goal or terminates quickly in low polynomial time~\cite{nir:icaps11}.
The basic building block of $\SR$ is the Iterative Width Procedure
($\IR$) for achieving one atomic goal at a time. $\IR$ runs in time exponential in
the problem width by performing a sequence of pruned breadth first
searches.  The planner $BFS(f)$ integrates a \emph{novelty} measure
from $\IR$ with helpful-actions, landmarks and
delete-relaxation heuristics in a Greedy Best-Fist
search.  

In the following sections we introduce the basic notions of the
algorithms and the implementation.
