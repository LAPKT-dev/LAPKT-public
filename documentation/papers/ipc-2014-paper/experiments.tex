
We call the resulting best-first search planner, BFS($f$), and compare
it with three state-of-the-art planners: FF, LAMA, and PROBE
\cite{hoffmann:ff,richter:lama,nir:icaps11}.\footnote{FF is FF2.3,
  while PROBE and LAMA are from the 2011 IPC.}  Like LAMA, BFS($f$)
uses delayed evaluation, a technique that is useful for problems with
large branching factors \cite{richter:preferred-ops-and-deferred}.

.  .  .  .  I can generate a table with results over the last IPC
taking 5min max, (agile track) and keeping just the time score.

On the other hand, runing the 30min anytime-algorithm will take ages..., and
we should run lama-anytime as well for compare comparison. we may skip this,
unless you think it's really meaningful...
