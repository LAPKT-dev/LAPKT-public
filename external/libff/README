This directory contains the C implementation of Metric-FF, as it was
used in the 3rd international planning competition. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

ff

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,

ADDENDUM: Compiling FF as a library
May 2009

In order to compile FF as a static library - so we can use the parsing &
grounding features - you need to issue

$ make depend
$ make libff

This will generate the libff.a archive file, and then

$ make test_lib
$ ./test_lib

which should compile and link without problems (this program checks that
the archive is usable).

Have (more) fun,
