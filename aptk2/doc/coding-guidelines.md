This is a work-in-progress document trying to sketch some of the coding guidelines that are followed in the project,
for the sake of reference and consistency.
Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

## General Style
* We use spaces instead of tabs. Or try to.
* We (try to) use a moderate maximum line width of 80 characters.
* In general, we prefer underscores to camel-case names: `void build_index() {...}` 
* We prefix class attributes with an underscore as well: `_index`
